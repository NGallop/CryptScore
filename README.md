# CryptScore
An R script that cycles through IHC image annotations counting how many crypts stained negative, how many patches of negative crypts there were, the size of the patches and how many crypts showed unusual staining. It also compiles the data from all the files for one case and analyses how many crypts and pacthes were found across the whole case.
